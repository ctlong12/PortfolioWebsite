                    <!-- Intro -->
                    <blockquote>
                      Malware and other phishing attempts are becoming more widely spread than ever before
                      in the world today. People today continue to move more and more of their daily routines,
                      memories, and transactions over to digital devices. The issue here lies with the amount of
                      sensitive data people move over to their digital devices. This sensitive data gives hackers
                      incentive and leaves people prone to attacks from black hat hackers attempting to gain and
                      wrongfully use that data. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of botnets to obtain this
                      sensitive data. A Botnet by definition is a network of private computers infected with malicious
                      software and controlled as a group without the owners&#39; knowledge These attacks implemented
                      using botnet makes botnets a very dangerous threat to anyone using a device today. Previously
                      completed research shows much difficulty in predicting malicious botnets. This ever-growing
                      need for a solution to the rapidly increasing number of botnets on the internet today still remains
                      up in the air. What makes this problem even more difficult is that not all botnets are technically
                      malicious. Botnets are used by corporations every day to help solve costumer service related
                      issues, help users buy products, and much more. Using machine learning, the goal is to properly
                      identify a botnet on a website using key features that all botnets abide by. Once able to properly
                      detect a botnet, many doors will open up in the world of cybersecurity that allow internet
                      websites to manage this ongoing problem.
                    </blockquote>
                  <h2 class="post-title" style = "font-weight: bold;">Previous Research</h2>
                  <br>
                    <p>There’s been quite a bit of research already on botnets and the ability to detect them using
                        machine learning. To get a better understanding of the problem at hand, referencing these
                        publications gives a solid foundation on which to build a machine learning model upon. Reading
                        these publication not only show how to attack the problem at hand, but also help determine new
                        original features that haven’t been looked into yet. Some of these original features such as failed
                        validations on a website, and failed login attempts will be covered in detail later on. Some of the
                        more notable publications on this topic are as follows.

                      In short, Bhattacharya’s research concentrated on the Analysis and Implementation of selected
                      bot detection methods that were independent of common detection techniques. Using flow based bot detection techniques that are generally considered metadata, Bhattacharya profiled for
                      HTTP/P2P/DNS based Botnets. Bhattacharya’s research without a doubt pushed people in the
                      right direction for selecting appropriate features in machine learning models.

                    <p style="font-style: italic;">By: Maria Jose Erquiaga, Carlos Catania, and Carlos García Garino</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Erquiaga, Catania, and Garino realized that nowadays botnets have become one of the most
                      dangerous threats for system administrators. They noted the many different attacks botnets can
                      perform such as spam, denegation of service, key logging, and traffic sniffing. In their
                      publication they analyze some of the most relevant network traffic characteristics used for botnet
                      recognition. In turn their publication allows for deciphering what unusual network traffic looks
                      like which helps scale people a models features appropriately.

                    <p>
                    Gu, Perdisci, and Lee’s research on botnets recognize that they are the key platform for many
                    internet attacks, such as spam, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), identity theft, and phishing.
                    They state that most of the current botnet detection approaches work only on specific botnet
                    command and control (C&amp;C) protocols (e.g., IRC) and structures (e.g., centralized), and can
                    become ineffective as botnets change their C&amp;C techniques. In their publication, they helped
                    guide an understanding of the different types of botnets and how they work. With someone with
                    no clue as to what a botnet is, their research sheds light onto this unfamiliar subject while once
                    again helping to choose appropriate features.

                    Saad, Traore, Ghorbani, and Sayed’s research proposed a new approach for characterizing and
                    detecting botnets using network traffic behaviors. Their approach focuses on detecting the bots
                    before they launch their attack. Saad, Traore, Ghorbani, and Sayed’s research was one of the first
                    publications mentioned here that focused only on network data which in turned help someone

                    <p>
                    Ranjan and Chen addresses the problem of detecting bots in network traffic based on a
                    classification models. Using machine learning algorithms, Ranjan and Chen based their model on
                    features extracted from network data associated with either known malicious or known non-
                    malicious client. Ranjan and Chen then apply the learned classification model to features
                    extracted in real-time from current network data. This publication not only brings the idea of a botnet machine learning model into a concept, but also shows the many types of botnet attacks
                    and how crucial research on this topic is.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Collecting the Data</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      FTo properly build a machine learning model for detecting botnets across the web, it is
                      important to obtain a dataset that can properly reflect internet traffic across the web. Due to the
                      nature of this problems complexity, it is crucial to research and choose the best features that will
                      yield the best results for the model. For this creating synthetic data since there are no publicly
                      offered datasets on botnets. The features chosen are as follows: number of login attempts,
                      number of failed validations, average byte flow, current byte flow, and whether or not a botnet
                      was detected. Each of these features mimics user account data that has been collected across a
                      single website. By examining these features across the entirety of a website, the goal is to
                      properly detect whether or not there are active botnets hidden among the users.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Model Features</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      <span style = "font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Number of Login Attempts</span> – Once a website is infected with a botnet, it goal is usually to perform some malicious attack by either accessing a user’s account to gain data, or imitating a user to extract information from the infected site. By keeping track of the number of failed login attempts it is possible to detect whether or not there is a botnet currently trying to access user’s accounts.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      <span style = "font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Failed Validation Attempts</span> -</span> - Throughout websites there are a number of codes or features for customers do not request an account name, a billing address, or any other personal identification information. Features like these are a perfect target for brute-force attacks that run through combinations quickly to look for valid pairs of credit card numbers and pin codes. Hackers use bots to execute these attacks. When an invalid pair is attempted, that generates a failed validation notification. If validation failures suddenly trend up or spike, then that might be a signal that bots are trying to steal information.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      <span style = "font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Average Byte Flow</span> - When botnets are trying to steal information, it usually involves extracting an pulling data back and forth from the infected website to the botnet host. Websites usually keeps tabs on the about of information that flow to and from their website. If there is a unusual spike in the amount of data that is being downloaded from a website at a particular time, it could be a botnet trying to extract information. Since the number of bytes are so important to detecting botnets, keeping track of the average byte flow on a site is a crucial feature for botnet detection.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      <span style = "font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Current Byte Flow</span> - Using the same logic as the average byte flow on a website, keeping track of the current byte flow across the site is another crucial feature for botnet detection. When the current byte flow is much higher than the average flow of bytes. The possibly of a botnet is very high.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      <span style = "font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Current Byte Flow</span> - By definition, a packet when referring to network traffic is the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the internet. A typical packet contains anywhere from 1,000-1,500 bytes. If the number of packets currently flowing across a website is abnormally high, it could be a good indicator that there is a botnet presence on the network.

                      In short, Bhattacharya’s research concentrated on the Analysis and Implementation of selected
                      bot detection methods that were independent of common detection techniques. Using flow based bot detection techniques that are generally considered metadata, Bhattacharya profiled for
                      HTTP/P2P/DNS based Botnets. Bhattacharya’s research without a doubt pushed people in the
                      right direction for selecting appropriate features in machine learning models.

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Logistic Regression Approach</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      To start the Logistic Regression model for botnet detection, specifying the independent
                      and dependent variables in the model represented as , then from there plugging the into a
                      sigmoid function. The sigmoid function creates a non-linear S-shaped curve where the curve has
                      a finite limit of as approaches and 1 as approaches . Since the base case of the Sigmoid
                      Function of is exactly 0.5, it is possible to accurately predict whether a variable is a 0 if its
                      probability is less than 0.50, or a 1 is it is greater than 0.50. Mathematically this can be
                      represented by taking our original value and plugging it into the Sigmoid Function represented
                      by . From there it is possible to solve for the in terms of the Sigmoid Function which results in
                      the equation . This equation will determine the probability and accurately classify the results.
                      Luckily there are many library’s that are able to handle the heavy mathematics involved with this
                      classification method.

                      yielded some very interesting results. A few of the more notable relationships between the
                      features happened to be between the number of failed validations and login attempts, and the
                      current byte flow along with the packet flow. The Logistic Regression model did a good job
                      accurately classifying the relationships between these features compared to others.

                      When applying the Logistic Regression we can see that the predictions results improved. The
                      model went from the base rate AUC of 50% and increased the odds of predicting the correct
                      outcome to 79%. Comparing these results to another classification method will be the best way to validate these results and determine how accurate the model really is.

                    <h2 class="post-title">Random Forest Approach</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For the second classification model we will be assigning a Random Forest Algorithm.
                        Random Forest algorithms are a supervised classification algorithm. This algorithm creates the
                        forest with a number of decision trees. The more trees in the forest the more in depth the forest
                        looks. Random Forest is build off of the idea of bagging which is a method of repeatedly
                        selecting data at random and then performing a decision tree classification method to it. The
                        genius behind the Random Forest Algorithm is that each new tree in the algorithm is grown from
                        the knowledge gained from the previous one. This method is highly accurate when applied to
                        classification problems.

                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Random Forest Results</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The results from the Random Forest model stood out more than the Logistic Regression
                        model. Once again the more notable relationships between the number of failed validations and
                        login attempts. Even more outstanding was that the Random Forest Algorithm had better
                        accuracy than the Logistic Regression model and the current byte flow along with the packet
                        flow.

                    <p>
                      When running the Random Forest model though the AUC scoring method, we can see that the
                      predictions results were better than that of the Logistic Regression. We went from the base rate
                      model AUC of 50% and increased the odds of predicting the correct outcome to 86%.

                    <p>
                      I’ve gaineda plethora of information about both topics that have without a doubt opened up many doors for
                      me in the future in this field. Attempting to tackle a project of this scale while being so new to
                      both fields have pushed my problem solving skills to the max while rewarding me with
                      knowledge on once unfamiliar subjects. Each subproblem that I tackled challenged me to attack
                      or look at my model in a different way that I never would have thought to. Intensive research
                      online such as previous research publication, or digging thorough machine learning
                      documentations have helped me overcome any challenge that I was presented with. With the
                      hindsight this project has gave me, the world of machine learning has opened up its doors to me
                      and I am very eager to perform more research in this field in the near future. Some of the more
                      important skills I have learned weren’t necessarily centered around the many different algorithms
                      and their approaches, a simple Google could handle that issue. In fact, the most useful skill I had
                      obtained is how to handle my data along and how to extract the most important features for a
                      model. One can learn and apply as hundreds of algorithms to a machine learning model, but if
                      the right features are being tested, the results will always be poor. If I were to continue my
                      research into the ongoing botnet problems that exist on the web today, not only would I collect
                      more data, but I would push further into whether or not these detected botnets were performing
                      malicious actions. With the retrospect of my project results, if I were to tackle this problem again
                      I would focus less on the algorithms I will be using and more on collecting accurate and useful
                      data. It was as if I kept hitting an invisible wall every time I tried to draw better conclusions
                      about my model. Obtaining more on realistic data is something that I was unable to find and I
                      feel as if it affected the end results of my model. I thoroughly enjoyed my journey into machine
                      learning and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for me in this field of Computer Science.
