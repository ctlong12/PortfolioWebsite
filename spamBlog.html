                      Email spam, or sometimes called junk mail are unsolicited messages that are sent electronically, mostly in bulk. Although most spam messages are commercial by
nature, spam messages open up a world of potential dangers for the average user. Spam is
known to disguise links that looks familiar, and then alternatively take you to harmful websites
that can jeopardize your privacy. These websites can lead to a variety of phishing scandals, or
even host malware that can infect your device. Even more alarming, these spam emails may
have executable scripts that can execute on your device from just simply opening the email
(trojans). With the increasing amount of spam mail sent and the dangerous associated with
them, the need for email companies and messaging apps to have a highly accurate spam
classifier is greater than ever. Most major email hosting providers already have spam classifiers
in place, but sometimes they don’t always work. Spam classifiers in your everyday setting are
littered with false negatives, such as when you find that important email you’ve been waiting
for marked as spam. This presence of false negatives as well as false positives indicates there
could be a better solution for identifying spam mail.

                    <blockquote style = "font-weight: bold;">The Process</blockquote>

                    <p>For my research, my overall goal is to successfully create a natural language processor (NLP) that can interpret strings in an email, and properly label them as spam or not spam. I will be diving into the code as well as the mathematics and theory behind the code that really makes this kind of classification model possible. My first step is to figure out my subproblems, the small goals to reach that break down this fairly complex problem into smaller, manageable chunks. My subproblems are as follows.
<br>
<br>

                    	1. Obtain dataset and find a relationship amongst the data
                    	<br>
						2. Build logistic regression model to predict the binary outcomes
						<br>
						3. Determine relationships amongst the different features
						<br>
						4. Construct NLP that targets elements found in the original dataset
						<br>
						5. Combined and test the two models in real world application </p>
                    <br>    
            
                    <p>These five subproblems make up the entirety of my research. Tackling each of these subproblems one by one will make the course of my research much less daunting and provide a proper outline of what to do next.</p>
<br>
<br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Obtaining Dataset and Finding Relationships</p>

                    <br> 
                      <p>
                      My first subproblem was to find a proper dataset that I could use to build my model off of. After a bit of research, I found a proper dataset online thanks to the UCI Machine
						Learning Repository. The dataset consisted of 4600 instances of emails, each which had be analyzed and categorized into 57 different associated attributes. These attributes consisted of the following.  
 
                    </p>                
                    <img class="img-responsive post-img" src="img/spam1.png" alt="Blog Post 1">
                    <img class="img-responsive post-img" src="img/spam2.png" alt="Blog Post 1">

                    <p>
                      The first and most important part of this dataset which caught my attention was the fact that each email had been marked as a zero or one. Zero if the email was not spam and one if the email was considered spam. This type of problem is a classic example of Logistic Regression. Using Logistic Regression I was examine the relationship between all the independent features and compare that to the dependent features. In my case, the only dependent (y) feature will be the zero or one that denotes whether or not the email was considered spam. All other columns are my independent (X) features, these are variables that I will use in order to make my prediction on my test set.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Making Predictions with my Logistic Regression Model</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      
Now that I have been able to find basic relationships amongst the different features in my dataset, I now will construct my Logistic Regression model in order to see how accurate my predictions are. After reading in my dataset, I will need to start feature scaling my objects. A usual between step could possibly be o take care of any missing data, but I was fortunate enough to have a dataset without any missing values. I will be using sklearns Standard Scalar class in order to take care of this issue. Feature scaling will but all my variables on the same scale so one large value does not outweigh all others. This makes my predictions much more accurate and thus helps reduce bias in the model. After scaling my data I will split my data up into the test set and the training set. The training model will be the one which my machine learning model learns from while the test model will be what I compare my results to. For this I will be using sklearns train_test_split class to differentiate between my two models. From there I will fit my scaler properties to my train and test models and it will be ready to have Logistic regression applied to the model. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After applying my Logistic Regression to my dataset I first struggled with how to exactly display my result. According to my confusion matrix. After applying Logistic Regression my test model successfully predicted 1064 emails correctly, and incorrectly identified 87. After a bit of research I was able to compare my results using a base rate model. The base rate model can easily be applied in this problem because of the binary outcomes of the model. What the base rate model does is set all the predicted values to the same type, in this case all the predicted values will become zero. We can use this base rate model to determine the basis on which we should shoot for in terms of model accuracy.</p>

                                      <img class="img-responsive post-img" src="img/botnet3.png" alt="Blog Post 1">

                  <p>Our base rate model in this problem came out to a value up 0.60. Or 60% of emails were guessed correctly simply by stating that all the emails were not spam. Using this observation we can automatically know that our model has to beat 60% to be better than the base rate model. Once our base rate model is established and we have ran the same test though our logistic model. We can start making inferences about the precision and accuracy of the model we have constructed. I performed this using a roc_auc_score which can correctly. An AUC (under the curve score) can correctly identify the accuracy of your model.</p>

                                      <img class="img-responsive post-img" src="img/spam3.png" alt="Blog Post 1">


                  <p>As observed above, the base rate models AUC score was 50%. Now that might sound somewhat okay until re remember that we only have two options zero or one. When we set the outcome to all zeros we are already guessing 100% of the emails that are not spam which results in the AUC score of 50% being the worst case scenario.</p>

                  <img class="img-responsive post-img" src="img/spam5.png" alt="Blog Post 1">

                   <p>After being able to conclude that my Logistic Regression model is accurate. I will test the results of other classification models by using other approaches like Random Forest selection, and K- Nearest Neighbors algorithms to better my prediction odds.</p>

                                       <br>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Determining Relationships Among Variables</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>

Since our Logistic Regression model is now complete, my goal is to further examine the features that may influence the models decisions over another. For example, in my model I noticed about 9 times out of 10 whenever an email was classified as spam, the feature of repeating characters and capitals letters more the most part outnumbered the number of repeated word features. Using methods from np, I was able to identify the top 5 features that weighted into the decision the most when classifying these emails. I plan to further examine this relationship between capital letters, char repetition, and word frequency in the future to determine which one makes the biggest impact on the model.
                    </p>

                                        <br>
                                                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Building a Natural Language Processor</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    	
The next large step in my design will be to construct a natural language processor in order to take real world input and use it as test data in my machine learning model. For example, the outcome is to copy an email into my machine learning model, have my NLP analyze the email and create the same features in the dataset, then import the new data into my model to receive instant feedback on whether or not the text was spam or not. In order to accomplish this I will be using methods from the Natural Language Toolkit offered for python. Using this toolkit I will be interpret my text so it can be used in my model.
                    </p>

                                                            <br>
                                                            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Combining the Models</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                The last step is to combine my NLP and my Logistic Regression Model in order to complete the build of a funny functional spam detector using machine learning. This will be my final step in my project in which I hope to have a live demo showcasing the work in real time. There have been many attempts to build spam detections models such as this one. A recent study conducted by the Journal of Big Data
investigated just a bag of words approach where the presence of individual words are used as features; however, several studies have found that this approach is not sufficient to train a classifier with adequate performance in review spam
detection. Another approach which has been tested was using a bayesian classification
algorithm is applied to distinguish the suspicious behaviors from normal ones. Having this working model is the fun part, where I get to step away from the numbers and create a fun way to use my model and test its prediction accuracy. Once this is complete, I would have successfully created my spam detection model.
